This project implements a Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange encrytion scheme *(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)* for a secure TCP connection between a client and a server.

**Build Instructions**
`javac Server.java`
It would run the server and if there any messages, it would show the encryted message and then decrypt it.

`javac Client.java`
It can be run on a client machine and can be connected to server. 
It has the ability to send messages to server in encryted format.
